                <div class="answer">Lines of cleavage are of utmost importance to surgeons, because a cut made parallel to a line of cleavage will usually remain closed with only minimal bleeding. Such a cut heals with a minimum of scarring. By contrast, a cut made at a right angle to a cleavage line will be pulled open as cut elastin fibers recoil. This cut will bleed profusely and will produce much scar tissue as it heals.</div>
